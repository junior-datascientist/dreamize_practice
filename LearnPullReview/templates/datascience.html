    <h1>I Know a Lot About Data Science</h1>

    <p>
        Data Science is more than just a buzzword for meâ€”it's a passion. I've spent a lot of time studying and applying it in real-world projects.
        From analyzing data to building machine learning models, I have gained deep knowledge in many key areas.
